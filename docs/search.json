Over the 32 years, we see a dip until 2020 before it rises back up again until it peaks at 2015. It appears that the birth rate has a rising and falling pattern shifting from rising to falling every 10-15 years."

    "text": "The original data came from this data set: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2020/2020-02-04/attendance.csv?plain=1\nThis data compares the attendence of the Green Bay packers and the Minnesota Vikings throughout the seasons of 2018 and 2019. Based on the graphs, it appears that on average the Packers typically have a higher attendence during a game compared to the Vikings. There are fluctuations however due to things such as home and aways games and success that season. For example the Packers had higher success in the 2019 season than in 2018 so their attendence was higher throught the year."

The graph shows the 10 characters with the highest total lines in the show. As you can see Micheal dominates the share of lines through his time with the office. As he leaves following season 8, you see a jump in other characters roles as they needed to fill the gap that Michael left. This graph shows the importance that he had to the show.\n\n\nShow the code\nthats_what_she_said &lt;- the_office_lines |&gt;\n  mutate(lower_lines = str_to_lower(Line)) |&gt;\n  mutate(quote = str_extract(lower_lines, \"that’s what she said\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(quote)) |&gt;\n  mutate(season_text = str_c(Season)) |&gt;\n  group_by(season_text) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  add_row(count = 0, season_text = \"1\") |&gt;\n  add_row(count = 0, season_text = \"8\")\n\nggplot(thats_what_she_said, aes(x = season_text, y = count)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Season\",\n    y = \"Quantity of Jokes\",\n    title = \"That's What She Said Jokes a Season\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14), \n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 15),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 15),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart above shows the quantity of “that’s what she said” jokes there are through the show, broken down by season. As you can see in the chart, they created the joke starting in season 2 and slowly declined in use as the show went on before michael’s departure in season 7. There is a return in season 9, likely due to Michael’s return for the finale.\n\n\nShow the code\nwords_preceding_she_said &lt;- the_office_lines |&gt;\n  mutate(lower_case = str_to_lower(Line)) |&gt;\n  mutate(char_following = str_extract(lower_case, \"(?&lt;=that’s what she said).\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(char_following)) |&gt;\n  group_by(char_following) |&gt;\n  summarize(count = n())\n  \nggplot(words_preceding_she_said, aes(x = char_following, y = count, text = char_following)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Character following\",\n    y = \"Appearences\",\n    title = 'Character following \"Thats what she said\"'\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 16),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 16),\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chart above builds upon the previous chart. This breaks down how the characters used following the “that’s what she said joke”. This is able to tell us how the joke was presented. For example, we are able to figure out that more often than not, the joke is not written as Michael screaming out “That’s what she said!”, rather he delivers it less excited. You are also able to see that it is written in other ways as well such as the ’, which is a line where Jim quotes the joke inside of a question."
