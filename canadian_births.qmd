The original data came from this data set: [here](https://jlaw.netlify.app/2023/12/04/are-birth-dates-still-destiny-for-canadian-nhl-players/)

This data shows how births varied in Canada throughout an individual year and over the years from 1990 to 2022. Over the 32 years, we see a dip until 2020 before it rises back up again until it peaks at 2015. It appears that the birth rate has a rising and falling pattern shifting from rising to falling every 10-15 years.
