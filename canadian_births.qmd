The original data came from this data set: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/2024/2024-01-09/canada_births_1991_2022.csv

This data shows how births varied in Canada throughout an individual year and over the years from 1990 to 2022. Over the 32 years, we see a dip until 2020 before it rises back up again until it peaks at 2015. It appears that the birth rate has a rising and falling pattern shifting from rising to falling every 10-15 years.
