This project was developed for my Foundations of Data Science course, where I explored methods for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing large datasets. I designed efficient data pipelines to process raw information, applied statistical techniques to uncover meaningful insights, and created clear visualizations to communicate results. The project emphasized both technical implementation and data-driven storytelling, highlighting the importance of making complex analyses accessible and interpretable.
